# Own-Vocabulary
You can create your own Vocabulary: English and another language. You can check yourself in translating.

You write the word and press Button "Translate". If this word is in your vocabulary, you'll get
the translation. If it isn't, you can add this word and its translation in your vocabulary.

If you want to check yourself you may open TestForm.
You can choose 4 options: all words, only verbs, except verbs, only phrasal verbs.

I write verbs to my vocabulary with "To". E.g. "To sleep".

So, if you check the option "only verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
whick starts of "To " (with 1 space).

So, if you check the option "except verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
whick don't start of "To " (with 1 space).

So, if you check the option "only phrasal verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
whick starts of "To " (with 1 space) and have at least 3 words. E. g. "To turn into".
