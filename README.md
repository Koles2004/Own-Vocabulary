I write verbs to my vocabulary with "To". E.g. "To sleep".

So, if you check the option "only verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
which starts of "To " (with 1 space).

So, if you check the option "except verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
which don't start of "To " (with 1 space).

So, if you check the option "only phrasal verbs", you will get all words from your Database,
which starts of "To " (with 1 space) and have at least 3 words. E. g. "To turn into".

So, if you check the option "only verb "Get"", you will get all words from your Database,
which starts of "To get " (with 1 space after "get"). E. g. "To get up".
